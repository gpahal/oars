# Course Allocation System (OARS)

This is a course allocation system where registered students may request for available courses and professors can offer courses and can optionally define filters and preferences to automatically accept or reject.

This project is built using the [*Django framework*](https://www.djangoproject.com/). The frontend is based on [*Twitter Bootstrap*](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [*AdminLTE template*](http://almsaeedstudio.com/AdminLTE/).
