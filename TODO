Tasks:
    *- Insert Accept, Reject button in the waiting list.
    *- Sort waiting list with respect to preferences.
    *- Use course limit in course_requests, course_filters.
        Students not accepted because of limit exceeded will be put in a waiting list and those that passed the
        initial filters (got accepted) will get a preference of 10. Request.limit_exceeded will be set to true for such
        requests and will help in finding them.
    *- Use is_offered in course_requests, course_filters, courses_offered, course_listing, course_search and others.
    - Implement course plan and timetable clash if possible.
    - Allocate appropriate permissions to professors and dugc's. Don't allow them to alter courses of other
        professors or departments. Also, dugc's have limited filter permissions.
    - Make the forms on course_requests and course_filters responsive.
    - Improve admin, especially ManyToMany fields.
    - Site structure (admin and main site).
